**Introduction to Different OMICS Approaches and their Applications – Detailed Notes (Prof. Vineet Kumar Sharma, NPTEL-NOC IITM)**

***

**1. Defining OMICS & Its Branches**
- **OMICS:** Large-scale, comprehensive study of biological molecules and their roles in structure/function.
- **Main OMICS fields:**
  - **Genomics:** Study of entire genomes—structure, sequence, gene organization.
  - **Transcriptomics:** All RNA transcripts—mRNA, non-coding RNAs (miRNA, lncRNA, etc.), gene expression.
  - **Proteomics:** All proteins—identification, quantification, modifications, interactions.
  - **Epigenomics:** Chemical modifications (DNA methylation, histone marks) regulating gene expression which do not alter DNA sequence.
  - **Metagenomics:** Community-wide analysis of DNA directly from environmental or clinical samples—uncultured microorganisms diversity and function.

***

**2. Evolution & Importance of OMICS**
- Shift from single-gene/protein studies to global, integrative understanding of biological systems.
- Generated data volumes are immense (“Big Data in Biology”).
- OMICS data is essential for advancing: medicine, biotechnology, agriculture, ecology, and environmental science.
- High-throughput methods key: next-generation sequencing, mass spectrometry, microarrays, etc.

***

**3. Workflow in OMICS Research**
- **Experiment Design:** Define biological question, sample collection, preparation.
- **Data Generation:**
  - Sequencing (Sanger, NGS, Nanopore, PacBio) produces raw data.
  - Proteomics: Mass spectrometry methods (MALDI-TOF, LC-MS/MS).
- **Data Storage & Retrieval:**
  - International databases: NCBI, EMBL, DDBJ, EBI, UCSC, Ensembl.
- **Data Analysis:**
  - Scripting (Linux, Python, Perl, R) for manipulation, curation, quality checks.
  - Specialized algorithms (BLAST, assembly tools, annotation platforms).
  - Bioinformatics pipelines: open source and custom.
- **Interpretation & Application:**
  - Structural, functional, and integrative insights.
  - Feedback into further experimentation (computational–experimental loop).

***

**4. Genomics In Depth**
- Whole-genome sequencing/assembly/annotation.
- Mobile elements, gene structure, repeats, and regulatory elements.
- Comparative genomics: study of related genomes, phylogenetics, evolutionary traits.

***

**5. Transcriptomics In Depth**
- RNA-seq, microarray approaches for gene expression profiling.
- Investigation of splicing events, isoforms, promoter usage.
- Differential expression studies under various conditions.

***

**6. Proteomics In Depth**
- Protein extraction, digestion, and separation.
- Identification using mass spectrometry.
- Analysis of post-translational modifications (PTMs) and protein–protein interactions.

***

**7. Epigenomics In Depth**
- Techniques: ChIP-seq, bisulfite sequencing, ATAC-seq for studying DNA/histone modifications.
- Importance: developmental biology, disease etiology (especially cancer and hereditary diseases).

***

**8. Metagenomics In Depth**
- Amplicon sequencing (16S rRNA/ITS) and whole metagenome approaches.
- Biodiversity estimation, taxonomic profiling, functional insights into uncultured communities.
- Microbiome research: human health, agriculture, bioremediation.

***

**9. Applications**
- **Medical:** Cancer genomics; precision medicine (pharmacogenomics); pathogen surveillance.
- **Agriculture:** Marker-assisted selection; genome editing; stress response studies.
- **Biotech/Industry:** Enzyme prospecting, production pathway engineering.
- **Ecology/Environment:** Community profiling, ecosystem health monitoring.

***

**10. Future Directions & Challenges**
- Continuous growth in data volume (exponentially increasing).
- Need for advanced computational infrastructure (HPC, cloud).
- Algorithm and software development to keep pace.
- Cross-disciplinary training combining biology, informatics, statistics, and computer science.
