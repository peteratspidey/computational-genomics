# Introduction to Different OMICS Approaches and Their Applications

---

## 1. Defining OMICS & Its Branches

**OMICS:** Large-scale, comprehensive study of biological molecules and their roles in structure and function.

### Main OMICS Fields
- **Genomics:** Study of entire genomes—structure, sequence, and gene organization.
- **Transcriptomics:** Study of all RNA transcripts including mRNA and non-coding RNAs (miRNA, lncRNA, etc.); focuses on gene expression.
- **Proteomics:** Study of the complete set of proteins—identification, quantification, modifications, and interactions.
- **Epigenomics:** Study of chemical modifications such as DNA methylation and histone marks that regulate gene expression without altering DNA sequence.
- **Metagenomics:** Community-wide analysis of DNA directly from environmental or clinical samples; explores diversity and function of uncultured microorganisms.

## 2. Evolution & Importance of OMICS

- Shift from **single-gene or protein studies** to **global, integrative biological understanding**.
- Explosion in data generation leading to the era of **“Big Data in Biology.”**
- OMICS data underpin advances in **medicine, biotechnology, agriculture, ecology,** and **environmental science**.
- **High-throughput technologies** such as next-generation sequencing, mass spectrometry, and microarrays are core to OMICS research.
